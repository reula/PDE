# Basic concepts of topology

## Introduction

The notion of a set, while indicating that certain objects —the elements that comprise it— have something in common, does not give us any sense of the *closeness* between these elements. On the other hand, if we consider, for instance, the real numbers, this notion of closeness is evident. We know, for example, that the number 2 is much closer to 1 than 423 is. The concept of a topology on a set, which we will define below, aims to precisely capture this notion of closeness, which, as we will see, allows for many gradations.

es un conjunto y $\mathcal{T}$ es una colección de subconjuntos de $X$ satisfaciendo
