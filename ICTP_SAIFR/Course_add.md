## ICTP-SAIFR Course on Partial Differential Equations:  Analytical and numerical tools.

### Oscar Reula, Pablo Montes and Joaquin Pelle

Many natural phenomena, including wave propagation, transport, diffusion, and equilibrium configurations, are modeled by differential equations. These phenomena span length scales from the nanoscopic to the cosmological and timescales from femtoseconds to billions of years. Despite their importance, the coverage of these topics by most graduate-level science curricula remains quite limited. On the analytical side, the focus tends to be restricted to the study of specific solutions obtained in highly symmetric situations. Meanwhile, on the numerical side, they generally only deal with basic implementations, if any, of simple techniques applied to particular examples. This course aims to explore both analytical and numerical tools to help students understand the dynamics of various phenomena, while simultaneously enabling them to find practical solutions to real-world problems and engage in numerical experimentation.

In this course, we will adopt a dual approach: on one hand, we will study the properties of some of the key differential equations, and on the other, we will develop methods for numerically finding approximate solutions to them. These two tracks are interdependent; rather, they complement and reinforce each other. This is the main aspect we aim to emphasize throughout the course, as we believe it is highly productive. It fosters interaction across different disciplines, from the specific field in which the phenomenon is studied to its more abstract mathematical counterparts. 

Thus, the objectives of the course are to enable students to become familiar with the foundations of the theory of the most common types of differential equations (ordinary, hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic), helping them understand their distinct behaviors and numerically approximate their solutions to validate these behaviors. Throughout the course, students will engage with codes of varying complexity, either modifying existing ones or developing new ones. They will employ these codes to solve a range of problems, including boundary and initial value problems, among others. Additionally, they will analyze the solutions they find, visualizing them, identifying extrema, monitoring their energies and other conserved quantities, and scrutinizing numerical convergence.

The course will be very intensive, and will be structured with approximately 4 hours dedicated to theoretical foundations, 4 hours of numerical theory, complemented by an additional 2 hours focused on practical exercises or coding each week during 8 weeks. The coding component will be conducted using Julia, involving relatively straightforward modifications of notebooks that are already operational, albeit for simpler or different examples.

### Prerequisites

Notions of Calculus and Linear Algebra, preferably some exposure to Mathematical methods. Some experience with computers and computer languages. It is expected that the students have previously installed [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and adquiere minimal experience with it. We will help with this but only in solving problems or specific questions.
