## ICTP-SAIFR Course on Partial Differential Equations:  Analytical and numerical tools.

### Oscar Reula, Pablo Montes and Joaquin Pelle

Many phenomena in Nature are modeled by differential equations. They include wave-like bahavior, transport, equilibrium configurations, diffusion, etc. These phenomena rage from nanoscopic space-scales to cosmological ones, and from phantosecond time-scales to, again, cosmological ones. Yet their knowledge in most of graduate science courses is very limited, ranging in the analytical side to study of particular solutions obtained in situations of high symmetry. While in the numerical side are restricted to very basic, if any, implementation of basic techniques to very particular examples. This course aims to develop tools, both analytical and numerical so as to allow students to understand the dynamics of the different phenomena involved as to find practical solutions to real-world problems.  

In this course we will purse a double track, on one side we shall study the properties of some of the prominent differential equations, on the other we shall developed methods of numerically finding approximate solutions to them. These tracks are not independent, and they reinforce each one from the other. This is the part we want to enphasise along the course because we think it is very prolific since it allows for interactions among different disciplines, namely from the actual discipline where the phenomena is studied to the very abstract mathematical counterparts. 

Thus, the objectives of the course are to enable students to become familiar with the foundations of the theory of the most common types of differential equations (ordinary, elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic), understand their diverse behaviors, and numerically approximate their solutions, thereby validating these behaviors. Throughout the course, students will be required to work with codes of varying sophistication, either modifying existing ones or creating new ones. They will employ these codes to solve different types of problems, including boundary and initial value problems, among others. Additionally, they will analyze the solutions they find, visualizing them, identifying extrema, monitoring their energies and other conserved quantities, and scrutinizing numerical convergence.

The course will be very intensive, and will be structured with approximately 2 hours dedicated to theoretical foundations, complemented by an additional 2 hours focused on practical exercises or coding. The coding component will be conducted using Julia, involving relatively straightforward modifications of notebooks that are already operational, albeit for simpler or different examples.
