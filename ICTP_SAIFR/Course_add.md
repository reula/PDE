## ICTP-SAIFR Course on Partial Differential Equations:  Analytical and numerical tools.

### Oscar Reula, Pablo Montes and Joaquin Pelle

Many phenomena in Nature are modeled by differential equations. They include wave-like bahavior, transport, equilibrium configurations, diffusion, etc. These phenomena rage from nanoscopic space-scales to cosmological ones, and from phantosecond time-scales to, again, cosmological ones. Yet their knowledge in most of graduate science courses is very limited, ranging in the analytical side to study of particular solutions obtained in situations of high symmetry. While in the numerical side are restricted to very basic, if any, implementation of basic techniques to very particular examples. This course aims to develop tools, both in the analytical side, but also in the numerical techniques 
Numerical techniques play a pivotal role in addressing differential equations, serving as a foundational tool across various domains, including physics, astrophysics, biology, climate scientes, to name a few, and several practical technological fields. In the contemporary landscape, it is imperative to recognize their significance as an integral component of a researcher's professional toolkit within these disciplines. Unfortunately, the current state of undergraduate and graduate curricula falls short in adequately incorporating this essential knowledge. The deficiency extends to both numerical and analytical aspects. Numerical courses typically remain at an elementary level, while analytical courses often hark back to methods predating the most significant advancements in the field. Emphasis is often placed on analytical methods, which may exhibit dubious convergence, and are limited to situations where closed-form solutions are attainable, or cases marked by high symmetry.

Regrettably, these conventional approaches prove insufficient for tackling the complexities of contemporary scientific problems. The majority of modern challenges are encapsulated by partial differential equations, governing phenomena at scales ranging from the nanoscopic to the cosmic. A comprehensive education in numerical techniques, equipped to handle such intricate problems, is indispensable for researchers navigating the multifaceted landscapes of present-day science.

Objectives:
The objectives of the course are to enable students to become familiar with the foundations of the theory of the most common types of differential equations (ordinary, elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic), understand their diverse behaviors, and numerically approximate their solutions, thereby validating these behaviors. Throughout the course, students will be required to work with codes of varying sophistication, either modifying existing ones or creating new ones. They will employ these codes to solve different types of problems, including boundary and initial value problems, among others. Additionally, they will analyze the solutions they find, visualizing them, identifying extrema, monitoring their energies and other conserved quantities, and scrutinizing numerical convergence.

Methodology:
The course is structured with approximately 2 hours dedicated to theoretical foundations, complemented by an additional 2 hours focused on practical exercises or coding. The coding component will be conducted using Julia, involving relatively straightforward modifications of notebooks that are already operational, albeit for simpler or different examples.
