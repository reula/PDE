## Introduction and motivation

In this book we attempt to introduce the reader to the bast field of Partial Differential Equations. 
They are used to model an impresive set of natural phenomena, ranging form events occurring at nano-scales or much smaller to cosmological scales, and corresdingly, from phantoseconds to deep time. There are many good books covering the analytical aspects of it, usually specialzing in some of their subclases, or even in precise aspects of particular equations and many others covering the numerical aspects relating to obtaining sufficiently accurate approximations to their solutions for cases of practical interest, yet others covering the necessary numerical analysis tools needed for making those approximations robuts and credible. Here, at the expense of depth, we propose a walk through the different types of equations, at the same time studying their analitycal properties and finding numerical approximations that allows to see in practice these properties and behaviors. Thus, we will deepends into the basic analytical tools which not only allow to show the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions for a given type of problem, but at the same time will allow for asserting convergence of the numerical approximations which in parallel we shall be producing.
