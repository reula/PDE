    "### **Why This Fixes the Issue**  \n",
    "- The original mistake was assuming $ (\\text{sgn}(y_n)) \\in c_0 $, which is false in general.  \n",
    "- The fix uses **finitely supported** sequences $ x^{(N)} $, which **do** belong to $ c_0 $ and approximate the norm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Conclusion**  \n",
    "The corrected proof shows that:  \n",
    "1. Every $ y \\in \\ell_1 $ induces a functional $ f_y \\in c_0^* $ with $ \\|f_y\\| = \\|y\\|_1 $.  \n",
    "2. Every functional in $ c_0^* $ arises this way (as previously established).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $ c_0^* \\cong \\ell_1 $ **isometrically**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for catching that error—it’s an important subtlety in duality arguments!\n",
